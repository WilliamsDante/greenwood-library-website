# Enhancing a community library website

It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Your team decides to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.
